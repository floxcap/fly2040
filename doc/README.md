# fly2040

RP2040 board is intended to be connected to I2C port #1.

The V1_V2 image shows the points I used for my mod.
The Lite image shows the likely points for a Lite board - but has not yet been confirmed or tested.

You may be able to trace the board layers/i2c points using: [Board Layers](https://balika011.hu/switch/)
